## The Issue:
- How might we encourage our drivers to **increase their work performance** by providing on-time deliveries? 
- How might we make it **more convenient** for our consignees to show appreciation to our drivers for a delightful delivery experience?
- How might we find **new homes for returned parcels** still in good condition (that would otherwise take up space in warehouses)?

## Our Idea:
We want to improve the experience for both customers and drivers:
- customers:
  - greater convenience to tip
- drivers:
  - earn points for delivering parcels within the designated time frame
  - also earn points for receiving good ratings
  - can use the points to exchange for returned parcels 
  - incentivised and encouraged to perform better
  
## Our Solution:
For the customers: a webpage to provide feedback in an easy way.

For the drivers: a webpage to track their points and exchange them for rewards.
